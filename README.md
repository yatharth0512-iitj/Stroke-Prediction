# Stroke-Prediction

This project involves comparison of performance of various machine learning models in order to estimate the likelihood of an individual experiencing a stroke. The dataset used contains essential factors such as age, gender, presence of diseases, and lifestyle habits like smoking status. The dataset underwent pre-processing steps such as handling null values, encoding categorical data, and balancing imbalanced data using the SMOTE technique to ensure accurate predictions.

Various classification algorithms including K Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, and Perceptron were implemented and evaluated for stroke prediction. Among these, the Random Forest algorithm performed the best with an accuracy of 92percent and an F1 score of 0.21. The project's objective is to find a machine learning model with significant performance that can identify stroke occurrences and determine the primary factors contributing to strokes.
